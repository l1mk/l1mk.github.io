I grew up with the prerogative that videogames were, well, just for kids, merely a new toy or distraction, it was seen in my culture like a none productive interactive medium, and that playing was bad and addicting and so forth. I never truly believe any of that and I spent my whole life as a fierce defender of the reason of why I play and what I was playing. See, in my eyes videogames were the future in humans enterteinment and for those expectical, let me tell you, it is probably the present for most human been already. The medium has achieved the highest growth in technology and the most profits in comparison to others like music and movies. I feel proud nowadays, to see how much it has been embraced in our society, on how easy is to spot a videogame character on a grocery store or a tv add, it is facisnating to see how famous some of the heros of my childhood have become and how accepted as cool, far from been the normal back in my days as a kid, it is impressive the achievement in the field and the appreciaton that you can even find museum with exposition on the subject. 
Videogame is a form of art, not just an interactive software, it is an expression of human dreams, a combination of abstract and stories, of characters and colors, of ideas and sounds. Is the end result of everything we hope for that we can't see, do, or achieve in our real life. It is also a social medium, a way to connect, to compete, to colaborate, to share from and with others humans. It is a way of learning, from values of good and evil, motor skills and reflex improvement, and math and physics, and in my particular case, a new language. Video games is so much, it has been for me, and that is why I embarced in this journey of coding, to be able to create my own piece of Art.
