I'm finally back at blogging, and for some reason I was trying to completely runaway from it. Ive found myself extremely busy in life, between my real job, my side business and my new side gig "photography", I am probably doing too much in a such a short period of time. 

But that is how life is right now, funny, is that in someway or another, all take me back to continue my development as a software engineer, because not matter what field or industry you go, it is almost mandatory the usage of web applications and the expertise on this subject is what can set you apart from the rest. 

I am in the need to reread some of the old classes and review some of the previous projects because at this point we are integrating a lot of our previous classes, making this a challenging but fun task.

For this project, I am considering combining my photography business with a web applications that can be useful for me for later usage, like a data base of clients, made for photographers, to track the jobs and associate that to prices and specific clients and dates. Curious enough I found myself developing a website using Wix because I am not ready to build it myself, even thou I understand a lot of what is required, nevertheless, I can see myself tweaking my base website little by little thanks to my new learnings. I already have plans to eventually integrate my first project: "one quote a day" on a section I left open for the website, and well later on, add this data base of clients as well, and for that, well, wish me luck!.


Slowly but steady, maybe a bit too slow lately. Im back here, with the priority to learn what is needed to make this my new set of skills that will help me propell all my other career adventures.
