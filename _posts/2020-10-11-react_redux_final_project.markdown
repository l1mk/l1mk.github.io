Exciting news, after almost 15 months I am finally finishing my course to become a full stack webdeveloper. This last project was very fun and very easy to make, or at least to the standards of the project requirements. The reason for it, is because I have learned how to "learn" the new lenguage and tools after all this time. And that is very exciting. I am not afraid to jump and investigate and play around and all, because I know that failing, trying, testing, is all part of the process.

For my last project I decided to go for a board game, since I have been a videogame lover my whole life and one of the many reasons I have to learn how to code is because I wanted to understood and eventually create myself an original game.

The task was not easy since I believe React is not a library created for any smooth animations and actions and the documentations was not as vast, as others like javascript. What end up making the project a bit more unique and harder to copy or at least follow from others in the web.

I used the state of components, and the states saved in the store as my most important aspects to make this game to work. 

Creating the structure, the menus, the links and even fetching data back and forward from the API is very simple thanks to the middlewares React offers, the complication can when I started to get into the start of the game where more variables are modified and read at the same time.

I learned a lot, and even if the game is not fully the game I envisioned in my head, is a great start, and a great first step to later improve and reuse everything I learned.

My last project, cant believe it and I cant wait to dwell now more into UI/UX and see where my new path career take me!!!

Thanks you for all.
Happy Coding y'all.
