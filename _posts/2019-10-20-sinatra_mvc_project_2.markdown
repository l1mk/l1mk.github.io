Welcome back guys, I am a bit behind but I finally finished my Sinatra Content Management System app, I am very happy with it, because I realize how useful its going to be for my personal usage on my side gig as a photographer.

I learned a lot on the previous classes and is exciting to have the chance to apply everything in something of your creation.

Starting from basic stuff like the HTML body of the app, and how to use CSS stylesheet to change the way you present the website. To the powerful SQLite that allows to have data storage for later use, like the list of clients I decided to record and the photo sessions I do for them. But I will say the most impressive is the easiness and usability of Active Record, making the creation of the models and controllers something so simple to use, following the standards in CRU, everything is pretty much the same format, and the only challenge is understanding what exactly you want and need from the app, like having login, to limitating the access of certain data according to the user, etc.

I am very proud of this project, and even thou it took me longer than before, it was more for personal issues ive been having in my life and not for difficulties on the project itself.
I can definetly see product of bootcamp come to live and is something exciting, there was challenges and there always will be some, like when I didnt know how to erase my database or when I couldnt figure out why certain pages werent loading with the proper stylesheet or even worse when I didnt know how to keep or erase a client from a session, I realized that everything require some patience, a lot of try and error and investigation, the answer can be found out there and more important that becoming an expert on coding, is to know that as a good troubleshooter / problem solver profesional, no matter the spec of your career, your mission will be always to NOT GIVE UP, keep trying, keep looking, ask for help, the internet is there full of resources and so it is the community, so dont let anything stop you!.

Keep on the good work, ill be trying to do the same!.

PS: checkout the project if you are a photographer and give me your feedback!
