Hello World, i have been away, a lot of thing going on but must important, ive been preparing to deliver my first CLI Project!, its been really exciting to create something from zero, and its amazing how with so little skills (compare to other things I learned in my life, including college) ive been able to develop something, with so much possibilities , you know?, there is infinite potentials to the tools we can create thanks to coding and the internet.

I choose to develop a gem (or program, I cant get used to the word gem for some reason) that was both usefull to me, to others and prove the things that I learn on this first part of the bootcamp. The name of the program is called "A Quote A Day", and its a simple tool to obtain random quotes from different categories from the internet on a simple clean way, that is also allows the user to save these quotes for a later use. Sound simple? well it wasnt that hard after I learned a couple of tricks with the labs and the classes but to me, its a great tool for anyone that is needing some nice words to start the day. Since the boom of the internet and social media, and the advance of technology we have at our reach more information than ever before, there is no excuse to not know about something or how to do anything nowadays, as professional, in no matter what field, is becoming more and more important to know where the information is located than actually knowing stuff. But all these perks, all this options, all this knowledge, can be sometimes damaging for ourselves, we endup isolating ourselves more and that is why, I believe that a program, like this one, can just aliviate or remind us some good old phrases, some nice words of courage and sometimes that little motivation we all need to strive to be better and take advantage in full of all the benefits that we are allow in the age of the internet.

It may sound simple, and maybe it is. But the power of reminding someone that is not alone, that he is capable and strong, or a simple joke that can make you smile. It will be always worth the trouble. So here it is, I hope you guys enjoy it!

Until next time...

All the Love,
