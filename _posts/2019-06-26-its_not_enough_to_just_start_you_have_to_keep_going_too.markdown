After so many delays i'm finally trying to fight back this bootcamp, even thou life gets in the way, like literally there is a lot of things in the way as the likes of Vacation traveling, Family emergency, Computers failing down, AC broken at the house, Hobbies that suddenly became a career oportunity and a bunch of other distracting thing, I am commited to finish and accomplished my goals to become a full stack developer. And the goal is not just to graduate of something else, and yeah eventually make more money and etcs, the goal is a prove on how much we need to continue growing and evolving from our past selves, leave the comfort zones and push harder in life in order to achieve better and obtain new experiences. We have one job, every day we wake up, and it is to move forward and just do better be better than yesterday. We are the product of our actions, we dont do anything complaining about how hard life is, it wont solve any problem, just like coding, you have to use those errors, those mistakes, those failed attempt, and just learn from them, find new ways, approach situation differently until you get what you want.

After all, if we dont do it ourselves, if we dont keep going, who is going to do it for us? and more important....what are we here for?
