Coding nowadays has become (and it will continue to increase on weight) a major skill to learn for any professional that has certain contact with technology. As a proactive and a computer lover myself, I can see the importance for me to start this venture that I has been putting on a side for so long.

Growing up as a low resourse kid in a third world country, that loved videogames with huge chunks of free times and imagination, I found myself creating the things I couldnt get, like new games, new stories, new toys, new heros, all of them out of paper and cardboard. As a teenaer I dreamed on the chances to be able to study the trades, attending to schools like MIT or more specific institution like DigiPen, dreams that were a little too high at the moment. As an adult, after graduating college as an Electronic Enineer and with the coming of the internet I fooled around with certains point and click softwares and tutorial videos  where I could finally put some of my ideas to work, but I never finished anything. 
Even after all this time, life, was always in the way some way or another taking my attention and time. 

It took me a while, but im finally here, with enough reasons to believe that not only I will learn how to code and create softwares that will allow me to start a career as a developer in a big  company where I can make an impact but also for myself as a want to be video game maker. 

Buckle up and lets this adventure start.
