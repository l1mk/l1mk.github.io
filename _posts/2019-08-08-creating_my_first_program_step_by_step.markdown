I was a little scare this last two weeks while trying to put together my first proyect, and then I realized I barely mentioned any technical aspect on this blog about this whole process, so I decided to come back today with some hindsights on the steps on how I manage to finish my proyect.

I will say that my first step was after watching all the videos the labs recommended, was to put down on paper all my ideas, the different escenarios and options, the purpose of the app and even draw some ideas for colors and icons, of course those, cant be used for this proyect, but again I got excited, since ive been using websites to find nice quotes to use as captions on my post in social media, I wanted to be able to scrape similar info from the internet, I saw this as a perfect need and opportunity to create something I will be capable to use, and thanks to that the idea of A Quote a Day came to my mind.

Following some of the examples on the Music Library CLI and the Worlds Best Restaurants CLI, I created the file/folder structure with the help of the "Bundle Gem" command and copying some of the data from those gems to imitate anything that i might require, had to read a lot about require and require relative and understanding the reasons of some of the files created by the bundle, like "gemfile" "gemlock" "rakefile" "readme".

Then I started with the basics, testing out the excution of my bin file, starting with a simple puts hello world command.
After making sure everything was running, and running again after every major addition, (and after finding a solution to a "pry" and a "rake" error that was driving me crazy), and making sure all the files were loaded on the correct order, I started develop the inside of the program, taking a fake data approach, with that I mean, I was going to develop the program that was going to return a default text instead of my desire quotes from the internet.

Testing every step, every IF, and every PUTS, to make sure the program was doing what I wanted to do even if it was only returning a fix data, it was a mayor step in the process because it helped me find errors easier and the same time get pumped to see that I was creating something new from scratch and it was taking the form of my desire program.

It definetly helped that I wrote down a pseudo code on how my program should react to every interaction, and this helped me building the interface, and after a couple of hours I was ready to start creating the different "classes" and separating the responsabilities to what object what was suposed to be doing.

The "scrapping" part of it, was definetly something I had some doubts on whetever use different websites and even different classes for each website but I ultimately decided to go for the easiest-simpler approach and leave any improvement for a upgraded version of the gem.

Following that, it was just more streamlided, specially polishing the details on how the program (or the text on it) should look and the way that it react to the user interaction. 

After all this process, my mind was extremely excited with the possibilities and I couldnt believe the progress that this past few weeks of classes, videos and labs have achieved on my skills. Coding can be accesible it doesn have to be scary and just realized that. More so, its a great reminder on the importance of it to develop a more productive future in any field and im very happy to be in the road to learn more in depth of it. I have not finished and there is plenty for me to learn and upgrade in this and the following proyects, I know that and I wont stop...
