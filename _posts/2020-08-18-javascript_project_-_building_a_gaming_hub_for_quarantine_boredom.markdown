Hi guys, it has been a while, las time I posted was during the presentation of my previous project. Life has changed for everyone with the pandemic and the forced house arrest we are all experiencing.

Im excited to deliver this new project, It took me a couple of months, I think since April that I started learning Javascript and all the amazing things you can do to modify an HTML file, and right after I finished the module, that took me around a month, by then I felt like I wanted to learn more before jumping into the project development.

I found some youtube tutorials and started watching everyday until one video got my attention, an hour lesson on how to build 7 different games using javascript. So I took on the challenge, watch them, learned, and improved every bit of those games, with added features like start pause reset, timers, top scores, and the best part, a more suitable aesthetic and animations to look like an actual game.

After probably two weeks and while in the process of playing around on how to make each app better, I got the idea that for my project, I wanted to present a hub were a bunch of games can be played, and all scores from all players can be compared, using the minimalistic games I just builded.

The process has been tought, life, you know, work, relationships and even health has been delaying my advance but finally today im able to showcase a MVP of what I expect to be a cool project to improve on to be something fun, at least for the kids bored at home. 

I think that the best part of all, is how much homework, investigation, trail and error, and a lot of self descovery is apply throught the whole process, is not only knowing what you are doing but knowing where to look for answers, the internet is there with all the knowlegde, someone else im sure has already experience the same issue, is just a matter of putting on the discipline, to show up and work every day, to create something that is yours.

Javascript has a lot to offer, is impressive how much it is used on every website outhere, and the possibilities to create a web app that is accesible throught a regular browser, make all this a great appealing to whats come next after we graduate.
