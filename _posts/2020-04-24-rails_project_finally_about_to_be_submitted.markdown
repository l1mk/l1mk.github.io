Hi guys, its been a while, actually a bunch of months of me working on this project, I have learned a lot but at the same time I've taken longer than I should, but you know, Life sometimes, can be distracting.

I'm still proud and happy for this project, I decided to build a tool to be used on the previous company I work for, funny and interesting how, even if I dont work there anymore, I can come out with ideas or tools to solve common problems or find ways to be more efficient. Its part of the whole knowledge I keep receiving from this bootcamp and all you guys that are there to help and support. It is pretty awesome.

The project started a bit ambitious on scope, I wanted to be able to track every single sales done by the same team of the company, and get a way to filter all by type, date, client, weeks, and salesman. Not only that, but been able to connect them to the teams they belong and show different view according to the position of the employee on the company. I wanted this tool to be available to them and maybe, just maybe, if it works as intended, charge some money from it so I have been taking my time. Granted I noticed I dont know how to make it available for others just yet so...

I also realized that it has been a bigger challenge, that has been kept me a bit frustrated for sure. I ended with a lot of models and associations, some of them are confusing and some are maybe not necesarily but im getting to the point where changing things might be harder than just start from scratch, so I decided, that even if the tool is not completely the way I want to be, it is a functional rail app that can work for me to pass my test and move on with my classes. With the new knowledge I will earn, the new skills I can learn, I can go back and improve the tool to make it the way it was intended. 

Now hear me out, is not like I gave up on it, but it has been too long and I need to move on, Im still happy with the results, even something as small as having the total numbers of sales on a different colors accordingly to the standards of the company, just little things like that gave me a sense of proudness, that when you get to solve problems or create new solutions, it is an amazing feeling and a prove that im on the right path or career. This is something I can be great at and is very satisfactory. 

All in all, I hope you guys get to learn something from all this, One: Dont be a perfectionist!, Two: Be proud of the work you do, because after all, it is yours!...

Until next time
